"""
If you use this implementation, youâ€™ll find that it behaves in the manner shown earlier:
>>> a = get_spam('foo')
>>> b = get_spam('bar')
>>> a is b
False
>>> c = get_spam('foo')
>>> a is c
True

One way to clean this up is to put the caching code into a separate manager class and glue things together
like this:
